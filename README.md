The "MyPortfolio Site" project is a comprehensive portfolio website builder that explores the implementation and comparison of two architectural paradigms: microservices and monolithic architectures. This project aims to provide users with the ability to create and manage personalized portfolio websites while leveraging modern cloud infrastructure for enhanced performance and scalability. By utilizing Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), the project integrates container orchestration to facilitate efficient deployment and management of the application components.
